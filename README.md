# ethernity-gateway

## Description
There can be multiple instances and they allow to optimize geographical connections. The connections between the datacenters are optimized getting a lower latency in different points of the map.

The operation is simple, the client connects to the gateway and the gateway has an established connection with the specified service, to which it sends all the traffic received.

NOTE: No blocking logic must be included by IP or others in this service. There are other layers (Firewall) designed for that.
